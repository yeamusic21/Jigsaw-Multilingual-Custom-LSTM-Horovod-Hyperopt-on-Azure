# Jigsaw-Multilingual-Custom-LSTM-Horovod-Hyperopt-on-Azure

Running Hyperopt on Custom Horovod LSTM on Azure for Jigsaw Multilingual Competition

## The Competition

https://www.kaggle.com/c/jigsaw-multilingual-toxic-comment-classification

Hosts:  The Conversation AI team, a research initiative founded by Jigsaw and Google, builds technology to protect voices in conversation. A main area of focus is machine learning models that can identify toxicity in online conversations, where toxicity is defined as anything rude, disrespectful or otherwise likely to make someone leave a discussion. If these toxic contributions can be identified, we could have a safer, more collaborative internet.

Objective:  Build multilingual models with English-only training data.
